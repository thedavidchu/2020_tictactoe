# 2020_tictactoe
Tic-Tac-Toe player in C. Just to brush up on my C!

## Functionality
The Tic-Tac-Toe player can look one move ahead and either attack or defend accordingly. Otherwise, it will do a random move.

Input moves by entering the square number that you wish to select (from 0 to 9) and hit ENTER. The AI will generate its move automatically.

## Testing
It is possible to defeat this Tic-Tac-Toe by starting in the centre. If the AI goes on the 

## TODO
I am probably not going to work further on this project, since it was mainly to have fun. But here is a list of things that would be fun to implement

### Basic Game Play
- Make single- vs. double-player functionality
- Create a GUI
- Make the labelling of the squares more distinct (O and 0 look similar in some fonts)
- Allow users to select the character that they wish to be-- e.g. if I want to be 'A', then it will play a 'A' on the board

### AI
- Make multiple levels of AI (Easy = Random, Medium = Look 1 move ahead, Hard = Never loses)
- Let the player choose whether the AI starts (i.e. whether it is 'X' or 'O')

## Future Projects
- I am working (about as diligently as I worked on this) on a Chess engine! Of course, it will not come close to solving the game, but I think it will be a fun challenge. It will either be in C or C++, since I have already made one in Python. With these software projects, I do not have my heart set on finishing them; they are mainly to hone and maintain my low-level language skills.
